This project focuses on creating a Heat Vulnerability Index (HVI) for Montana at the census tract level based on methodology developed by Shope (2023) with the New Jersey Climate Change Resource Center. Additionally, I test the methodology by incorporating two scenarios of Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis via the TOPSIS algorithm.
